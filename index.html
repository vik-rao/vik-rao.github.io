	 <b> <i>(IEEE published)</i> SmartAIR: Application and system street-level air quality monitoring[*] </b>: 
	 Live street-level air quality monitoring reveals human exposure to hazardous air pollutants while walking/biking/jogging on streets. 
	In this project we build interactive, efficient front-end application for end-users and robust back-end framework for servers. 
		<ul>
			<li>End-users experience faster and lively pollution updates with our application as it loads, renders pollution data in-under 10ms.</li>
			<li>End-users always need data and battery efficient application. So we experiment lazy load(LL) scheme(a concept of OS) to make our application more energy efficient. We conducted several real-life trials and we observed negligible mobile data consumption ( < 1MB for 1-hour ) and we observed negligible power consumption ( < 4% in 1-hour run ) in end-users device.</li>
			<li>Thus, our app is fast, saves data and conserves battery in the long-run</li>
			<li>Our data centers experience relatively lesser network load and less computation overheads on scaling up. 
			<li>In back-end, servers recieves immense amounts of data continously from large-scale of sensor networks. With our scalable policy specification
			we efficiently manage server load, utlimately cutting down ~83% of expensive operations@server</li>
			<li>Our implementation of novel policies and schemes provide real benefits to data centers and end-users. </li>

	 <br/><br/>
	 
	 <ul>
	 <li>Current IoT platform solutions are centralized cloud based computing infrastructures. A swarm of IoT devices relying on cloud can drastically increase cloud maintenance costs. With the advent of blockchain technology we can achieve decentralization and reduce cloud dependency. We will introduce blockchain technology in swarm of IoT devices and make an attempt to decentralize IoT swarm. </li>
	 <li>Development of fault tolerant abstraction layer for IoT swarm is crucial because IoT swarm may contain defective, misleading or malicious IoT devices. Thus we propose abstraction layer enhances security and trust in the system.</li>
	 <li>we will prototype reliable blockchain-based abstraction layer for IoT swarm to protect swarm against misleading, malicious IoT's. In this process, we will go through classic solutions like DLS, PBFT, BFT models and state of the art models as well. </li>
	 <li>However, we take first-step towards implementing reliable blockchain-based fault tolerant framework for a swarm of IoT devices.</li>
